  <h5><b>What is Carbon Footprint?</b></h5>
  {{! <p>A carbon footprint refers to the amount of greenhouse gases,
    particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), that are released into the 
    atmosphere as a result of human activities. It's a measure of 
    the impact that our daily choices and actions have on the environment, 
    specifically in terms of climate change.</p>
    <p class="info-points mt-5">The carbon footprint includes emissions from various sources, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Energy consumption:</b>  Burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas for electricity, 
        transportation, and heating.</li>
      <li><b>Transportation:</b>  Emissions from cars, trucks, airplanes, and other vehicles.</li>
      <li><b>Food production and distribution:</b>  Growing, processing, transporting, and storing food.</li>
      <li><b>Waste management:</b> Decomposition of waste in landfills and incineration.</li>
      <li><b>Industrial processes:</b> Manufacturing goods and products.</li>
    </ul> }}
  <p>A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (including
    carbon dioxide and methane) that are generated by our actions.</p>
  <p>The average carbon footprint for a person in the United States is 16 tons,
    one of the highest rates in the world. Globally, the average carbon
    footprint is closer to 4 tons. To have the best chance of avoiding a 2℃ rise
    in global temperatures, the average global carbon footprint per year needs
    to drop to under 2 tons by 2050.</p>
  <p>Lowering individual carbon footprints from 16 tons to 2 tons doesn’t happen
    overnight! By making small changes to our actions, like eating less meat,
    taking fewer connecting flights and line drying our clothes, we can start
    making a big difference.</p>
